# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(1)

# Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices
# of p's anagrams in s.
#
# Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of
# both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.
#
# The order of output does not matter.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"
#
# Output:
# [0, 6]
#
# Explanation:
# The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
# The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# s: "abab" p: "ab"
#
# Output:
# [0, 1, 2]
#
# Explanation:
# The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
# The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
# The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

Same idea from a fantastic sliding window template, please refer:

Time Complexity will be O(n) because the "start" and "end" points will only move from left to right once.

public List<Integer> findAnagrams(String s, String p) {
    List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
    if (s == null || s.length() == 0 || p == null || p.length() == 0) return list;
    int[] hash = new int[256]; //character hash
    //record each character in p to hash
    for (char c : p.toCharArray()) {
        hash[c]++;
    }
    //two points, initialize count to p's length
    int left = 0, right = 0, count = p.length();
    while (right < s.length()) {
        //move right everytime, if the character exists in p's hash, decrease the count
        //current hash value >= 1 means the character is existing in p
        if (hash[s.charAt(right++)]-- >= 1) count--;

        //when the count is down to 0, means we found the right anagram
        //then add window's left to result list
        if (count == 0) list.add(left);

        //if we find the window's size equals to p, then we have to move left (narrow the window) to find the new match window
        //++ to reset the hash because we kicked out the left
        //only increase the count if the character is in p
        //the count >= 0 indicate it was original in the hash, cuz it won't go below 0
        if (right - left == p.length() && hash[s.charAt(left++)]++ >= 0) count++;
    }
    return list;
}
